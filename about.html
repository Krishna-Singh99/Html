The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and domestic rival Snapdeal.[8][9] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[10] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[11] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface.
Acquisitions
In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[18] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[19] Following this acquisition, Flipkart launched their DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Because of competition from free streaming sites, the site was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[20][21][22][23]

With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[24] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for $280 million in May 2014.[25] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[26] In April 2015, Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it would use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[27] In December 2015, Flipkart purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia.[28] In 2016, Flipkart acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for $70 million and the UPI mobile payments startup PhonePe.[29][30] In January 2017, Flipkart made a $2 million investment in TinyStep, a parenting information startup.[31] Flipkart invested $35 million in Arvind Fashions Limited's newly formed subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands for a 27% stake in the company. Arvind Youth Brands owns Flying Machine.[32]

E-mart Wholesale recently launched a digital platform for kiranas and MSMEs.[33] In October 2020, Flipkart acquired a 7.8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail for $204 million.[34][35]

Partnerships
In April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary, eBay.in, to Flipkart and invest $500 million in the company. While eBay suggested that the partnership would eventually allow Flipkart to access eBay's network of international vendors, these plans never actually came to fruition.[36][37] In July 2017, Flipkart made an offer to acquire its main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for $700â€“800 million. It was rejected by Snapdeal, which was seeking at least $1 billion.[38]

In August 2019, Flipkart entered into a partnership with Authentic Brands to license and distribute Nautica in India.[39]

Flipkart invested $4 million in the customer engagement and rewards platform EasyRewardz on 19 November 2019.[40][41]
